# Wisp-Health

Wisp Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers across the United States. In 2019, the company launched a marketing campaign aimed at better understanding how to meet customer needs, focusing on categories such as wellness tips, plan affordability, and preventative care. As part of this effort, Wisp introduced four insurance plans, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, each offering different premium levels and claim coverage rates.

Recently, Wisp hired a data team to analyze how these campaign categories impact customer signups and patient claims. The goal is to use these insights to guide the marketing team decisions about budget allocations for the upcoming year, with the overall objective of increasing sign ups and boosting brand awareness nationwide.

# Dataset
The dataset analyzed consisted of 3 tables, covering information about the customers, the campaign category that garnered the customers attention, and the claim that ended up being filed with Wisp Health:

The Data in this project was divided into 3 sections each with its own set of metrics that told the story of the data.

Marketing Metrics:

* Impressions: The number of times content was seen, doesnt mean it was engaged, but does highlight visibility. 
* Click Through Rate (CTR): The percent of people who clicked Wisp's ad, gauges what garners audience interest.
* Cost-Per Cick (CPC): The amount Wisp pays everytime the content is clicked, reflects efficiency of spending budget.
